		<p>I have always enjoyed discovering new information, and then best figuring out how to share that with all types of audiences. What may have started with trying to figure out how to best share my excitement over Thomas Jefferson with my mother blossomed into a role as a University Tour Guide at the University of Virginia. There I had the chance to learn hundreds of pages of UVA history and facts, and then share it every day with a new, diverse audience. I gave almost 100 tours during my four years at school not for the glory (of which there wasn't much...) but because I love finding the best way to distill useful information for the audience at hand.
		</p>


		<p>In my first job out of school, I worked with financial trading software, troubleshooting programs during the trading day. Using SQL (which I took an immediate liking to), I'd have to parse through thousands of trades, securities and broker records to find useful and helpful information for clients. I really enjoyed the idea of taking otherwise opaque data and turning it into actionable, understandable information.
		</p>
		<p>With this in mind, I found the Metis Bootcamp online during my own research. Before applying, I knew I'd have to learn a lot of their pre-requisites (refreshing on statistics, reviewing Linear Algebra and teaching myself Python). I did so entirely on my own, and was accepted to the Spring Cohort of their NYC Bootcamp.
		</p>
		<p>If you're here, you may have seen some of my projects, ranging from predictions on MLB salaries to a dashboard helping to understand the NY State Legislature. I am excited to see where the next step takes me, and will always look out for a unique, insightful story to share.
