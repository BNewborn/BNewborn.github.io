Since graduating Metis, I have had time to work on personal projects as well as to continue to build skills in relevant, exciting aspects of data science and data analysis. As part of this, I have been working to learn Tableau on my own. And, as almost any data science or coding blog will tell you - the best way to learn something is to try it out yourself, figuring out steps as you go.

With this in mind, I downloaded [Redfin's Seattle Housing Data](https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center) (h/t to this Summer's Metis instructors for pointing out this dataset as a good practice set), and set to work finding effective ways to visualize this in Tableau.

One lesson that I have come to appreciate through my time at Metis and working on personal projects is that visualization is crucial to answering any business question with data. However, the question itself should dictate what the visualizations look like - not just what looks interesting or seems 'cool'. In this instance, I did not have a particular business question driving our analysis, so I imagined a few scenarios and created visualizations that could tell a story.

Just by viewing 2 quick graphs (well, 1 map and 1 graph), we can rapidly get a summary view of the Seattle housing market. We can see that neighborhoods on the eastern side of the city tend to have some of our most expensive sales, while neighborhoods to the north and far south have many more affordably priced properties. Secondly, we can see that although multi-family homes are the most expensive types of sales (the red color indicates the highest average gross sale), they lag far behind other types of housing in dollars per square foot. This tells us that the high-end buyers of Seattle are not likely getting more space for their money, and are likely chasing other factors; this could include ideal neighborhoods, distance from commercial areas (I wonder if Amazon's office being in walking distance affects housing prices... a question for another analysis!), or other demographic factors that are beyond our view.

Hope you enjoy! I will continue to practice with Tableau (and likely with datasets a bit more relevant to the east-coast life I live) and update here accordingly.

**TBD on getting the tableau dashboard itself embedded here. Until then, [click here](https://public.tableau.com/views/SeattleHousing_Tableau_Dashboard/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes) to view my dashboard.**
