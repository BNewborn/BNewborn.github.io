My name is Brian Newborn. I'm an aspiring Data Scientist studying as part of the Spring Cohort at Metis in New York City. I'm very interested in exploring how we can use data and machine learning to better serve society through government and patient-centered healthcare. I will be posting my Data Science projects here as well as other related musings. I hope you enjoy!

### More Information

I'm a big Mets, Knicks and Jets fan (pity me, I know!). When I'm not working in Python, I love to read my historical books outside or to play basketball with friends.
